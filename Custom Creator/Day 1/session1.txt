a lot of time researching for this session
had to figure out stuff like the base, tip, reference diameters for a gear
found a lot of equation for each
    since its based off of rev robotics parts i wanted to mimic their build pattern as well
    ex: module of 0.75, reference angle of 20deg

didnt spend too much of this session making the actual shape of the gear, mostly finding the equations to make it look right
also figured out how to do configurations in onShape. had a lot of difficulty with #boreshape
