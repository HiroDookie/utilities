continue final touches to custom gear creator's sketch
circular sketch!!
finally get to extrude! (gear8.jpg)

should function properlly now but im now doing some aesthetic changes
    ex: indented gear + protruding shaft collar

changed the coloring and had to figure out some more configuration stuff
    had difficulty with the checkbox configurations but its good now!

moved on to quickly create a custom hex shaft creator 
    went mostly well and i was pretty satisfied with what i had
went back to test that the gear configs worked

realized towards the end of the session that the gear config broke past teeth count 42

see gear8-11.png and hex1.png for this session
