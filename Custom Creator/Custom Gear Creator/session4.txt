a lot of troubleshooting the gear for this session

documented gear breaking at teeth 42, works fine at 41
realized my mistake after finding it wasnt the equations that was the issue (see gear 17.png), circular pattern wasnt centered properly causing misalignment between addendum and dedendum of gear tooth

see gear12-14.jpg

fixed indent also not working properly at teeth 42 (or maybe because i changed the sketch?)
see gear15-16.png

another issue i realied at teeth 100, dedndum was not properly fixed to base diameter
fixed with gear18-20.png

another issue with small gear teeth count
i apparently messed up a lot of the circular pattern because the addendum wasnt properly patterned either
fixed this and should work now (it did not)
indenting was broken because what was supposed to be the inner circle had a diameter greater than the outer circle
i had no real way of fixing this besides making the indent diameter only 1.5mm smaller/larger than the outer/inner diameters
    1.5 is basically useless so i just opted to limit the gear teeth to 20 where it wouldnt breaking
see gear21-25.png

also found the max for this issue
    probably around 150 but opted for max 125 as safety
see gear26-27.png

tested the gear and it should be all good now with proper limits
now moving on to the hex shaft
    i noticed it looked weird at a large diameter so i messed around and changed the sketches
    then realized that the diameter was not the only issue, the inner hex needed to be scaled proportionally to the larger hex so it looks normal
    very roundabout way of figuring out i didnt need to do this and instead just add a scale feature (nobody is going to use this anyways)

final minutes made a custom d-bore shaft (i dont think people actually use these or at least will use this utility)
